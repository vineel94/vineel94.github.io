    <p>I'm Vineel and welcome to my website! I'm currently a student at UT Austin studying economics and computer science and am an aspiring software developer.
          Super interesting.. right? Well, if you're still reading this, then I guess we better sail from Superficial Sea to Interesting Island.

      Basketball. I love it. One of the cool things about the game is that you get to observe peoples' personalities translate to decision making in real time. Anyone who has played with me will tell you that I ALWAYS go for the steal on defense, which is considered a gamble.
      And in case you couldn't already tell from my superficial sea to interesting island alliteration, I'm not afraid to gamble haha.

       At the heart of my personality though, I think, lies creativity. I try to channel this through several outlets like coding and sketching. In a perfect world, I'd want to be on the same creative stratosphere as
      Kanye but with the humility of Logic. That sounds paradoxical, I know.

    <p>
      I love meeting and having conversations with new people, especially, if we're talking about movies, technology, travel, or music! Oh, and sports too &#40; I love my Lakers and my friends might tell you that I'm a bandwagon Warriors fan. I firmly deny these allegations.&#41;.
